ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @timwroge. I am a computer vision engineer at Voxel. I am interested in algorithms, data structures, signal processing and controls. Some of my open source projects are described below:


These are academic or exploratory repositories that are in progress. The hope is that these will act like C++ libraries that are an extension of the C++ standard libraries (external math/applications)
* https://github.com/timwroge/Algorithms
* https://github.com/timwroge/Dynamics
* https://github.com/timwroge/Geometry
* https://github.com/timwroge/Visualization

Here are some fun projects that you can check out:
* https://github.com/timwroge/Stockchain
* https://github.com/timwroge/DeepPurple
* https://github.com/svi2/cloudy_mc_cloudface
* https://github.com/timwroge/TensorFlowGettingStarted


Here are some of my research based repos:
* https://github.com/timwroge/LFADS_CNBC_Pipeline
* https://github.com/timwroge/lfads-run-manager
* https://github.com/timwroge/CNBC
* https://github.com/timwroge/ReinforcementLearning
